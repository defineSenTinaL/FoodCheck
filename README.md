# FoodCheck: Knowledge Distillation for Food Identification

FoodCheck is an innovative deep learning project hosted on GitHub that aims to revolutionize food identification through the power of knowledge distillation. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this repository showcases a robust model trained to identify various food items accurately.

Key Features:
- Knowledge Distillation: The core of FoodCheck lies in the implementation of knowledge distillation, a technique that allows the model to transfer knowledge from a complex teacher model to a compact student model, achieving both accuracy and efficiency in food recognition.
- Extensive Dataset: We have curated an extensive dataset comprising diverse food images from various cuisines, ensuring the model's ability to recognize a wide range of dishes and ingredients.
- Pre-trained Models: To facilitate easy deployment and experimentation, we provide pre-trained student models ready for use in different applications.
- Evaluation Metrics: The repository includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, enabling users to assess the model's performance accurately and compare it with state-of-the-art benchmarks.

Why FoodCheck?
- Fast Inference: FoodCheck's distilled student model delivers real-time inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and mobile applications.
- Seamless Integration: With detailed documentation and well-organized code, integrating FoodCheck into your food-related projects becomes seamless and hassle-free.
- Open-Source: FoodCheck is an open-source project, encouraging contributions from the community to enhance and expand its capabilities continually.
