## Introduction
FoodCheck is an innovative deep-learning project hosted on GitHub that aims to revolutionize food identification through the power of knowledge distillation. Leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this repository showcases a robust model trained to identify various food items accurately.

## Key Features
- **Knowledge Distillation**: The core of FoodCheck lies in the implementation of knowledge distillation, a technique that allows the model to transfer knowledge from a complex teacher model to a compact student model, achieving both accuracy and efficiency in food recognition.
- **Extensive Dataset**: We have curated an extensive dataset comprising diverse food images from various cuisines, ensuring the model's ability to recognize a wide range of dishes and ingredients.
- **Pre-trained Models**: To facilitate easy deployment and experimentation, we provide pre-trained student models ready for use in different applications.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The repository includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, enabling users to assess the model's performance accurately and compare it with state-of-the-art benchmarks.

## Why FoodCheck?
- **Fast Inference**: FoodCheck's distilled student model delivers real-time inference, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments and mobile applications.
- **Seamless Integration**: With detailed documentation and well-organized code, integrating FoodCheck into your food-related projects becomes seamless and hassle-free.
- **Open-Source**: FoodCheck is an open-source project, encouraging contributions from the community to enhance and expand its capabilities continually.
